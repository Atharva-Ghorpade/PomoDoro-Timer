# Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It encourages focused work sessions followed by short breaks to enhance productivity and maintain concentration.

## How It Works

1. **Choose a Task:** Select a specific task or project to work on.

2. **Set a Timer:** Set a timer for 25 minutes, known as one "Pomodoro."

3. **Work:** Focus on the task for the full 25 minutes without distractions.

4. **Take a Short Break:** After the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break to relax and recharge.

5. **Repeat:** After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes.
